# noggin_f072cb

**Not Recommended for New Designs (NRND)** due to multi-year component shortage.

STM32F072CBU6-based NOGGIN containing minimum components for debug and communication with the rest of the vehicle.

The STM32F072CxUx and STM32F091CxUx should be drop-in compatible in case of component shortage.
